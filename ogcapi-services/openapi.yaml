        consist of multiple feature collections. A feature collection is often a
        collection of features of a similar type, based on a common schema.

    bbox:
      name: bbox
      in: query
      description: >-
        Only resources that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the
        coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (elevation or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
        WGS84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) 
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84 
        longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in a parameter `bbox-crs`.

        For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are the
        bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        If a resource has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the server 
        whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant geometries.

        * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"

        `datetime` are selected.

                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

                  If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
                  WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
                  unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in a parameter `bbox-crs`.

                  If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is
                  WGS 84 longitude/latitude/height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
                  unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in a parameter `bbox-crs`.

                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
                  the extent or all relevant geometries.
